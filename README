mobwrite-tornado  
================

Authors:
--------
Neil Fraser et al. - a gentleman and a scholar. A god among men. He wrote mobwrite
                     and the original daemons.

Avery Pennarun (apenwarr) - wrote a tornado wrapper around the original mobwrite
                            daemon. Also made some small fixes. See:
    http://groups.google.com/group/mobwrite/browse_thread/thread/871e899bec56d005

Michael Huynh (mikexstudios) - created this repo (clone from apenwarr); decided to
                               simplify the repository by stripping out all
                               files not related to the tornado daemon. Made some
                               small changes. This is me.

Purpose:
--------
1. Providing a simple repository to play with a tornado-based mobwrite daemon.

2. For furthering my own understanding.

3. Improve the tornado daemon and mobwrite javascript client by using HTML5 Web
   Sockets and tornado's new Web Sockets support.

What I am working on:
---------------------

1. Simplifying javascipt client by using web sockets.

2. Related to #1: Modifying daemon to use tornado's web sockets.

3. Understanding mobwrite_core and mobwrite_daemon so I can strip it down and
   make it more "pluggable" (eg. working with mysql backend or plugging into
   Django app).

How to use
----------

1. Install the prerequisites that are in requirements.txt. (I like to use a
   virtualenv environment; then invoke pip to install directly from the
   requirements.txt file.)

2. Run the daemon: python mobwrite.py

3. Visit http://localhost:3017/ in your browser.
